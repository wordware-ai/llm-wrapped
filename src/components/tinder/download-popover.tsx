              Go to https://account.gotinder.com/data. This is where you can
              manage your Tinder account outside the app.
            </li>
            <li>
              Log in with the same Facebook, Google, or phone number you used on
              Tinder.
            </li>
            <li>Click on &quot;Download My Information.&quot;</li>
            <li>
              Enter your email address in both fields. Tinder will send you the
              data to this address.
            </li>
            <li>
              Click &quot;Submit&quot; and you&apos;ve initiated the request.
              Tinder will soon send you an email that contains a download link
              to your data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once you get an email with your data, open Tinder&apos;s email and
              click on the download link within 24 hours of receiving the email.
              The download link is at the bottom of the email.
            </li>
            <li>
              Log into your account as you did the first time when you requested
              the data.
            </li>
            <li>
              After logging in, your data (myData.zip) will automatically
              download. Please unzip and open the file.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now, you can upload the data.json file to Tinder Wrapped and view
              your analysis!
